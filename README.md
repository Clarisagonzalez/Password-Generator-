# Password Generator Starter Code



## Description

The motivation for this project is to make sure the program is functional and generates safe and secure passwords for the end user. I built this project using Javascript to generate passwords that meet a certain criteria such as uppercase, lowercase, numerical and special characters providing greater security. It helps users to not use weak passwords so their information remains safe. I learned how to use an alert with different prompts asking specific questions to help generate a different a password each time.

## Usage

Demonstrates a series of prompts asking specific questions to generate a password from information collected by the end user.
